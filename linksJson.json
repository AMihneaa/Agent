It can be used as part of acryptographic protocolto provideend-to-end encryptionforinstant messaging. After an initialkey exchangeit manages the ongoing renewal and maintenance of short-lived session keys. It combines a cryptographic so-called \"ratchet\" based on theDiffie–Hellman key exchange(DH) and a ratchet based on akey derivation function(KDF), such as ahash function, and is therefore called a double ratchet."
